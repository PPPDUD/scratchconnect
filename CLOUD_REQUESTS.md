# ScratchConnect Cloud Requests v1.0 (beta)

This new feature was first released in version ```4.0.0``` of the ScratchConnect Python Library!

I was inspired to make this feature from @TimMcCool's scratchattch Python library.

**Using this feature, you will be able to send data to-and-from the Scratch project and your Python program.**

**Features:**
* Send any length of data without any data loss! (Tested in a good internet connection)
* Supports any number of arguments sent from the Scratch Project
* You can send any number of data length (or almost unlimited characters of data) to the Scratch Project in much less time!
* This feature is more fast compared to the Cloud Storage feature of this library
* This feature can handle many requests being sent at the same time using a queue system
* It has a built-in way to encode and send images to the Scratch Project!
